        <strong>Podcasts</strong> are spoken word audio files that can be
        downloaded and listened to on podcast players, like Spotify,
        ApplePodcasts, or Sticher. They can provide information about related
        topics, tell stories, or simply entertain the listener. Many people like
        to listen to them while working or doing chores around the house.

          <p>
            <span class="Podcast-name">The Adventure Zone</span> is a comedy
            actual play podcast hosted by brothers Justin, Travis, and Griffin
            McElroy and their father, Clint. Based on the role-playing game,
            Dungeons & Dragons, every other week, the brothers and their father
            adventure through magical, wooded, and undersea worlds in campaigns
            DMed by all four hosts. It is one of the funniest, exciting, and
            most heart-warming podcasts I have found. They are currently
            adapting their first campaign, the Balance Arc, into a series of
            graphic novels, and an animated tv show is in development.

            <span class="Podcast-name">My Brother, My Brother & Me</span> is a
            comedy advice podcast hosted by brothers Justin, Travis, and Griffin
            McElroy. Each week, the brothers alternate answering questions sent
            in by listeners and answering questions found on Yahoo! Answers.
            They also have sporatic segments like Munch Squad, where Justin
            reads press releases from fast food restaurants. It is a very funny
            podcast that every week leaves me laughing at my desk. The first
            episode of The Adventure Zone was actually an episode of MBMBaM,
            released when Justin was on paternity leave with his first child.
